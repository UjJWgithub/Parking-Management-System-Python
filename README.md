Parking management system for managing the records of the incoming and outgoing vehicles in a parking house

It's an easy for Admin to retrieve the data if the vehicle has been visited through number, he can get that data.

Nowadays in many public places such as malls, multiplex system, hospitals, offices, market areas there is a crucial problem of vehicle parking. The vehicle parking area has many lanes/slots for car parking. So, to park a vehicle one has to look for all the lanes. Moreover, this involves a lot of manual labour and investment. Instead of vehicle caught in towing the vehicle can park on safe and security with low cost.

Parking control system has been generated in such a way that it is filled with many secure devices such as, parking control gates, toll gates, time and attendance machine, car counting system etc. These features are hereby very necessary nowadays to secure your car and also to evaluate the fee structure for every vehicle's entry and exit

The objective of this project is to build a Vehicle Parking management system that enables the time management and control of vehicles using number plate recognition. The system that will track the entry and exit of cars, maintain a listing of cars within the parking lot, and determine if the parking lot is full or not. It will determine the cost of per vehicle according to their time consumption.

I have added my python code for this project which needs a user created mysql file or database to run this project.

I have made this project in a group and the members includes:- Me ,Puru Johri , Aditya Sharma , Priyanshu Rana and created a repository here on github.
